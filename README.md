# **MyMiniAutomationProjs**  
A growing collection of small, practical IT automation projects built to strengthen my skills in Python, system monitoring, scheduling, logging, data structures, and eventually machine learning and network automation.

This repository is my personal sandbox, experimental learning ground,  a place where I build, break, learn, and refine real‑world automation tools one project at a time.

---

## **About This Repository**
This repo contains a series of **mini automation projects**, each designed to be:

- Small enough to complete in a day or two  
- Realistic enough to reflect real engineering workflows  
- Modular and well‑documented  
- Focused on clean logic and reproducibility  
- Part of a larger roadmap toward IT automation, ML, and DS&A mastery  

Every project here is built from scratch, fully commented, and structured to grow with me as I advance from beginner → intermediate → advanced automation engineering.

## **Current Projects**
### **1. System Health Checker**
A Python automation tool that monitors CPU, RAM, and Disk usage, logs results to rotating log files, and triggers warnings when thresholds are exceeded.  
Includes scheduling, error handling, and modular functions.

More projects will be added as I progress through my automation roadmap.

## **Why I Created This Repo**
I wanted a single place to track my growth as an engineer — not just big portfolio projects, but the small, foundational tools that build real skill:

- Logging  
- Scheduling  
- Error handling  
- System monitoring  
- File automation  
- Data parsing  
- API usage  
- Network automation  
- Machine learning basics  
- Data structures & algorithms  

Each mini‑project helps me practice one or two core concepts in isolation before combining them into larger systems.

---

## **Roadmap**
This repo will eventually include projects such as:

- Excel‑Driven Device Inventory Manager  
- Log Analyzer with ML anomaly detection  
- API‑based automation tools  
- Data structures mini‑suite (trees, graphs, BFS/DFS simulations)  
- Network configuration backup automation  
- Configuration drift detector  
- Capacity forecasting with ML  
- Self‑healing infrastructure prototype  

This is a long‑term learning journey, and this repo is the home for every step.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- Python 3.9+  
- psutil  
- schedule  
- logging + RotatingFileHandler  
- openpyxl (future)  
- pandas (future)  
- scikit‑learn (future)  
- Netmiko / Paramiko (future)  

---

## **How to Use This Repo**
Each project lives in its own folder with:

- A dedicated Python script  
- A README explaining the project  
- Logs or output files (if applicable)  
- Clear comments and structure  

Clone the repo and explore any project:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MyMiniAutomationProjects.git
```

## **My Idea**
Automation is about writing **small, reliable, repeatable tools** that solve real problems.

# This is for educational and growth purposes
