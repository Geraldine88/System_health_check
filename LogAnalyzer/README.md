# **Log Analyzer**  
A Python automation tool that reads system log files, extracts useful patterns, identifies warnings or anomalies, and generates clean, human‑readable summaries. This project builds on the **System Health Checker** by teaching me how to *consume* logs, not just create them.

---

## **Project Overview**
The Log Analyzer is the second project in my automation series.  
While Project 1 *generated* logs, this project *analyzes* them.

It reads the log file produced by the System Health Checker, breaks each line into structured data, and produces:

- Color‑coded console summaries  
- Top 5 most frequent warnings  
- Anomaly detection  
- A bar chart visualization  
- Timestamped CSV exports  
- Automatic folder creation for exports  

This project strengthens my skills in parsing, data analysis, visualization, and automation workflows.

### Reads log files  
Automatically locates and opens the log file generated by the System Health Checker.

### Parses each log entry  
Extracts:
- Timestamp  
- Log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)  
- Message  

### Counts log levels  
Provides totals for:
- Information  
- Warnings  
- Errors  

### Detects repeated warnings  
Identifies the most common warning messages and lists the **Top 5**.

### Detects anomalies  
Flags unusual behavior, such as:
- Excessive warnings  
- Repeated patterns  

### Generates visualizations  
Creates a bar chart showing the distribution of INFO/WARNING/ERROR events.

### Exports results  
Saves a timestamped CSV summary into an automatically created `exports/` folder.

### Color‑coded output  
Uses ANSI escape codes to make console output easier to read.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python 3  
- pandas (CSV export)  
- matplotlib (visualization)  
- datetime (timestamping)  
- os (file handling)  
- ANSI escape codes (color output)

## **How to Run the Script**
From inside the `LogAnalyzer` folder:

```
python analyzer.py
```

The script will:

1. Read logs from the System Health Checker  
2. Parse and analyze them  
3. Print a color‑coded summary  
4. Generate a bar chart  
5. Export a timestamped CSV into `exports/`

## **Why This Project Matters**
This project teaches me how to:

- Parse real‑world log formats  
- Extract structured data from unstructured text  
- Build monitoring and alerting logic  
- Visualize system behavior  
- Export data for reporting  
- Automate file handling and folder creation  

These are foundational skills for:

- DevOps  
- Site Reliability Engineering  
- Cybersecurity  
- Backend engineering  
- Data engineering
